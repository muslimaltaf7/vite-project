        "Content syndication refers to the strategic republishing of content to expose it to a much larger audience in order to educate, engage, and qualify new leads. In a practical sense, that means your chosen piece of content, let’s say an ebook, is shared with the segment of our audience that matches your criteria. If viewers of that site, or members of that list are interested, they visit a landing page, fill out a form, and receive your content offer. You then receive a list of leads that you can nurture.",
